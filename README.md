# TextEditor-C
Minimalist Text Editor in C

Using doubly linked list i created a minimalist text editor similar to linux.
A function "touch" that creates a file , "mkdir" creates a folder and "ls"
shows them all, folders first and files after. I also made a function called
tree that shows the correct tree of files and folders , "rm" to remove
a file and "rmdir" that is a "rm -r" from linux , it deletes the folder with all
files associated, "cd" sent to a specific zone , also can use ".." to go back on root.
